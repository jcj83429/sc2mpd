== sc2mpd

*sc2mpd* implements a gateway for playing a Linn Songcast audio stream on
Linux.

It can work in two modes, either by forwarding the stream to MPD (using

provides a Songcast _Receiver_ interface (hopefully) usable from any
Songcast _Sender_ such as the Windows or Mac OS X Linn Songcast
applications.

It can works in two slightly different modes, reading mpd output from a
fido, or reading an ALSA input channel. In both cases, the interface is
provided by *upmpdcli*.
